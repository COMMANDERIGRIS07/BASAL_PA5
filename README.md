# PA5 — README
2ECE-C

## Project Title

Matrix Operations and System of Linear Equations Solver (PA5)

## Overview

This MATLAB script (`PA5.m`) focuses on fundamental linear algebra operations. **Problem 1** explores different transposition methods on both real and complex-valued matrices. **Problem 2** solves a $5 \times 5$ system of linear equations using two primary techniques: the **Inverse Method** and **Cramer's Rule**. This README explains the code's purpose and documents the parts cell-by-cell so you (or a grader) can understand exactly what each step does.

> **Note:** The current script uses the `j` symbol for the imaginary unit. In MATLAB, both `i` and `j` are standard conventions for $\sqrt{-1}$. Ensure your environment is set up to handle complex numbers correctly.

## Files in this assignment

* `PA5.m` — main MATLAB script containing the code for both problems.

---

## Requirements

* **MATLAB R2018a or newer** (recommended for standard linear algebra functions).
* A working MATLAB environment (Desktop or Online).

## How to run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Ensure the directory containing `PA5.m` is on the MATLAB Path or is the current working directory.
3. Type the filename and press Enter in the **Command Window**:
